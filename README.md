# Finance app

I have developed the Finance app, which is connected to server and takes data from there.
Used stack: React, TypeScript, Chakra UI, Socket.io.
- [DEMO LINK](https://vlad-shulzhenko.github.io/finance-test-task/)

## Description

Finance app includes light and dark themes. Was used visual effects to highlight positive or negative changes in the prices.
You can remove some ticker from your watchlist by clicking button `x`. Removed tickers are displaying in modal window, you 
can reach it by clicking button `View removed` (this button is disabled if you still have not removed any ticker).
You can add back ticker to watchlist by clicking button `+`.
